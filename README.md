# WebTaskManager
Welcome to the WebTaskManager! 

## 📚 Purpose
This project was started as a way to pass a specific subject in my studies. I wanted to learn about web applications and front-end development. I passed my subject and from then on am continuing this journey to deepen my skills. What I managed to learn so far:

- **WebSocket Integration**: Implemented real-time data updates in the application, enhancing the user experience.
- **Frontend Development**:
  - **Learned Bootstrap 5**
  - **Developed JavaScript knowledge**: dynamic and interactive UI components, such as the drag-and-drop tasks functionality.
- **Database Operations**:
  - **Flask-SQLAlchemy Integration**: Learned ORM concept and implemented it in my application.
  - **Data Relationships**
  - **Database Design**
- **Flask-Login**: Learned the intricacies of user authentication and session management.
